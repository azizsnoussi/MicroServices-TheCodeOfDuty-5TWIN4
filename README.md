"# MicroServices" 
Project Setup and Deployment Guide
This guide will walk you through the steps to clone, build, and deploy the project using Docker Compose. Please follow the instructions below to get the project up and running.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following software installed on your system:

Git
Maven
Docker
Docker Compose

Step 1: Clone the Project
Clone the repository to your local machine using Git:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/azizsnoussi/MicroServices-TheCodeOfDuty-5TWIN4
cd your-project

Step 2: Build the Project
Use Maven to build the project. Make sure you are in the project root directory:

bash
Copy code
mvn clean install

Step 3: Build Docker Images
Build Docker images for each project in the repository. Navigate to each project's directory and build the Docker image:

bash
Copy code
cd project1
docker build -t project1-image .
cd ../project2
docker build -t project2-image .

Step 4: Docker Compose
Navigate back to the root directory of the project and use Docker Compose to start the services. The provided docker-compose.yml file defines the services and their configurations:

bash
Copy code
docker-compose up -d
This command will start all the services defined in the docker-compose.yml file in detached mode.

Step 5: Testing
Once the services are up and running, you can test your application. Depending on your project and its services, open a web browser or use tools like Postman to interact with the application.

Access the services as needed using the appropriate URLs, such as http://localhost:port. Refer to each project's documentation for specific endpoints and usage.

Step 6: Stopping and Cleanup
To stop and remove the services, run the following Docker Compose command:

bash
Copy code
docker-compose down
This will stop and remove all containers defined in the docker-compose.yml file.

That's it! You've successfully cloned, built, and deployed the project using Docker Compose. Enjoy using the application!
